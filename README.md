# multi-agent-ai-system
Multi-Format Autonomous AI System with Contextual Decisioning &amp; Chained Actions
üöÄ Overview
This project is a robust, modular multi-agent AI system that processes Email, JSON, and PDF documents. It classifies both format and business intent, routes to specialized agents, extracts structured data, and dynamically chains follow-up actions such as escalation, alerting, or compliance flagging.
All processing steps and decisions are logged in a shared memory store for full auditability.

Shared Memory Store (Redis)
Classifier Agent: Uses OpenAI LLM to detect document format and business intent.

Specialized Agents: Extract/validate fields from Email, JSON, or PDF.

Action Router: Triggers follow-up actions (escalate, alert, compliance flag) via REST API.

Shared Memory: Stores all metadata, agent outputs, and action traces for audit.

üß© Agent Logic
1. Classifier Agent
Input: Raw content + filename.

Logic:

Uses OpenAI LLM with few-shot prompt examples and schema cues.

Detects format: Email, JSON, PDF.

Detects intent: RFQ, Complaint, Invoice, Regulation, Fraud Risk.

Output:

{ "format": "...", "intent": "..." }

Writes classification metadata (source, timestamp, result) to Redis.

2. Email Agent
Input: Email content.

Logic:

Uses OpenAI to extract sender, urgency, issue/request, and tone (escalation, polite, threatening, etc.).

Output:

{ "sender": "...", "urgency": "...", "issue": "...", "tone": "..." }

Writes extraction result to Redis.

3. JSON Agent
Input: JSON string (webhook data).

Logic:

Validates required schema using Pydantic.

Flags anomalies (missing fields, type errors).

Output:

{ "data": {...}, "anomalies": [...] }

Writes result to Redis; logs alert if anomalies found.

4. PDF Agent
Input: PDF file path.

Logic:

Uses pdfplumber to extract text and parse line-item invoice or policy.

Extracts invoice total, compliance terms ("GDPR", "FDA", etc.).

Flags if total > 10,000 or compliance terms found.

Robust parsing of LLM output for compliance terms.

Output:

{ "total": ..., "compliance_terms": [...], "flags": [...] }

Writes result to Redis.

5. Action Router
Input: Agent outputs.

Logic:

If urgent escalation: POST to CRM escalate API.

If anomalies: POST to risk alert API.

If compliance flag: POST to compliance API.

Else: log and close.

Includes retry logic and error handling.

Output:

{ "action": "...", "api_response": ... }

Writes action trace to Redis.

üîÅ End-to-End Flow Example
User uploads an email file.

Classifier Agent: Detects Email + Complaint.

Email Agent: Extracts sender, urgency=high, tone=escalation.

Action Router: Calls (simulated) POST /crm/escalate.

Shared Memory: Logs classification, extraction, and action for audit.

üñ•Ô∏è User Interface

Upload sample files (Email, JSON, PDF) and view step-by-step results.

üóÇÔ∏è Sample Inputs
Email: .eml or .txt files with various tones/intents.

JSON: Valid and invalid webhook samples.

PDF: Invoices and policy docs with/without compliance terms.

See the sample_inputs/ folder.

üì§ Output Logs
After processing, click "üíæ Save Output Logs as JSON" in the UI.

The logs are exported as output_logs.json for audit or submission.
